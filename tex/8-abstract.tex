\chapter*{Abstract}


\noindent With the aim of creating a complementary platform for the driver and their vehicle, this project employed a variety of integrated sensors both within the car and on the mobile device to develop a comprehensive data compilation platform.\\
The collection of vehicle information was carried out through the OBD-II port, present in all vehicles manufactured from 2010 onward in Brazil, while mobile data included crucial details about the vehicle's movement, such as geolocation and acceleration.\\
The subsequent transfer of this data to the AWS cloud facilitated a detailed analysis of each driver's profile. This approach not only provides a rich compilation of data from different sources but also allows for a thorough assessment of individual driving preferences and behaviors, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of vehicle performance and usage patterns.
