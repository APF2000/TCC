\chapter*{Abstract}


\noindent Aiming to create a complementary platform to the driver and his car, this work will use various sensors around a car and from a smartphone, for example, to develop a data capturing platform. \\
The gathering of car related data will be done through an OBD-II port, available in all vehicles manufactured since 2010 in Brazil. A few examples of data that can be captured from a phone are information about the movement of the car such as geolocation and acceleration.\\
The data, in turn, will be transferred to the cloud for profile analysis of each conductor. \\
Each driver will be able to consult their personal data through a system with authentication, which is an exercise of implementation of security, an aspect fundamental to data protection.
