\chapter*{Abstract}


With the aim of creating a complementary platform for the driver and his vehicle, this project took advantage of the infrastructure present in cars and \textit{smartphones} to be carried out.

Vehicle information was collected through the OBD-II port, present in all vehicles manufactured from 2010 onwards in Brazil, while cell phone data included crucial information about the vehicle's movement, such as geolocation and acceleration.

The subsequent transfer of this data to the AWS cloud made it possible to analyze the profile of each driver. This approach not only provides a compilation of data from different sources, but also allows for an in-depth assessment of individual driving preferences and behaviors, contributing to a more complete understanding of vehicle performance and usage patterns.
