\chapter*{Abstract}


\noindent This work specifies an open-source, open-hardware and low-cost gimbal system, intent on making this technology more widely accessible. The demand was identified bu group member Breno, who noticed that existing amateur equipment was very overpriced.\\
We determined the use of the ATMega328P microcontroller, for it is widely available to our users and is present on the Arduino development platform, that many of them already have. The chosen OS is armOS for its real-time capabilities, and it will communicate with the peripherals: a gyroscope, accelerometer, servos, buttons and LEDs.
