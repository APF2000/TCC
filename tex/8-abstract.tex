\chapter*{Abstract}


\noindent Aiming to create a complementary platform for the driver and his car, this work used different sensors inside a car and those present in a cell phone to build a data compilation platform.\\
Data collection from the car was done through an OBD-II port, present in all vehicles manufactured from 2010 onwards in Brazil. Examples of data collected from a cell phone include information about the car's movement, such as geolocation and acceleration.\\
The collected data, in turn, was passed to the AWS cloud, for profile analysis of each driver.\\
% Each driver will be able to consult their personal data through a system with authentication, which is an exercise of implementation of security, an aspect fundamental to data protection.
